Front-end development moves forward fast. A good indication of this is the pace at which new technologies appear to the scene. React is one of these recent newcomers. Even though the technology itself is simple, there&#x27;s a lot going on around it.

The purpose of this book is to help you get started …</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/react/getting-started">Getting Started</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
React, despite being a young library, has had a significant impact on the front-end development community. It introduced concepts, such as the virtual DOM, and made the community understand the power of components. Its component oriented design approach works well for the web. But React isn&#x27;t limit…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/react/getting-started/introduction-to-react">Introduction to React</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Facebook&#x27;s React has changed the way we think about web applications and user interface development. Due to its design, you can use it beyond web. A feature known as the Virtual DOM enables this.

In this chapter we&#x27;ll go through some of the basic ideas behind the library so you understand React a …</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/react/getting-started/setting-up-the-project">Setting Up the Project</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/getting-started/setting-up-the-project" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
To make it easier to get started, I&#x27;ve set up a simple Webpack based boilerplate that allows us to dig into React straight away. The boilerplate includes a development mode with a feature known as hot loading enabled.

Hot loading allows Webpack to patch the code running in the browser without a fu…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/react/getting-started/implementing-notes">Implementing a Note Application</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/getting-started/implementing-notes" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
Now that we have a nice development setup, we can actually get some work done. Our goal here is to end up with a crude note-taking application. It will have basic manipulation operations. We will grow our application from scratch and get into some trouble. This way you will understand why architect…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/react/getting-started/deleting-notes">Deleting Notes</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/getting-started/deleting-notes" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
One easy way to handle deleting notes is to render a &quot;x&quot; button for each Note. When it&#x27;s clicked we will simply delete the note in question from our data structure. As before, we can start by adding stubs in place. This might be a good place to separate the concept of a Note from the current Notes …</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/react/getting-started/understanding-react-components">Understanding React Components</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
As we have seen so far, React components are fairly simple. They can have internal state. They can also accept props. Beyond this React provides escape hatches that allow you to handle advanced use cases. These include lifecycle methods and refs. There are also a set of custom properties and method…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/react/getting-started/editing-notes">Editing Notes</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/getting-started/editing-notes" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
Editing notes is a similar problem as deleting them. The data flow is exactly the same. We&#x27;ll need to define an onEdit callback and  bind an id of the note being edited at Notes.

What makes this scenario difficult is the user interface requirement. It&#x27;s not enough just to have a button. We&#x27;ll need…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/react/getting-started/styling-notes">Styling the Notes Application</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/getting-started/styling-notes" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
Aesthetically, our current application is very barebones. As pretty applications are more fun to use, we can do a little something about that. In this case we&#x27;ll be sticking to an old skool way of styling.

In other words, we&#x27;ll sprinkle some CSS classes around and then apply CSS selectors based on…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/react/implementing-kanban">Implementing Kanban</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
In this part, we will turn our Notes application into a Kanban application. During the process, you will learn the basics of React. As React is just a view library we will also discuss supporting technology. We will set up a state management solution to our application. We will also see how to use …</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/react/implementing-kanban/react-and-flux">React and Flux</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/implementing-kanban/react-and-flux" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
You can get pretty far by keeping everything in components. That&#x27;s an entirely valid way to get started. The problems begin as you add state to your application and need to share it across different parts. This is the reason why various state management solutions have emerged. Each one of those tri…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/react/implementing-kanban/implementing-store-and-actions">Implementing NoteStore and NoteActions</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/implementing-kanban/implementing-store-and-actions" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
Now that we have pushed data management related concerns in the right places, we can focus on implementing the remaining portions - NoteStore and NoteActions. These will encapsulate the application data and logic.

No matter what state management solution you end up using, there is usually somethin…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/react/implementing-kanban/implementing-persistency">Implementing Persistency over localStorage</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/implementing-kanban/implementing-persistency" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
Currently our application cannot retain its state if refreshed. One neat way to get around this problem is to store the application state to localStorage and then restore it when we run the application again.

If you were working against a back-end, this wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. Even then having a te…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/react/implementing-kanban/handling-data-dependencies">Handling Data Dependencies</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/implementing-kanban/handling-data-dependencies" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
So far we have developed an application for keeping track of notes in localStorage. To get closer to Kanban, we need to model the concept of Lane. A Lane is something that should be able to contain many Notes within itself and track their order. One way to model this is simply to make a Lane point …</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/react/implementing-kanban/editing-lanes">Editing Lanes</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/implementing-kanban/editing-lanes" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">

We still have work to do to turn this into a real Kanban as pictured above. The application is still missing some logic and styling. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;ll focus on here.

The Editable component we implemented earlier will come in handy. We can use it to make it possible to alter Lane names. The idea i…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/react/implementing-kanban/drag-and-drop">Implementing Drag and Drop</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/implementing-kanban/drag-and-drop" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
Our Kanban application is almost usable now. It looks alright and there&#x27;s basic functionality in place. In this chapter, we will integrate drag and drop functionality to it as we set up React DnD.

After this chapter, you should be able to sort notes within a lane and drag them from one lane to ano…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/react/advanced-techniques">Advanced Techniques</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">

Traditionally, web pages have been split up into markup (HTML), styling (CSS), and logic (JavaScript). Thanks to React and similar approaches, we&#x27;ve begun to question this split. We still may want to separate our concerns somehow. But the split can be on different axes.

React doesn&#x27;t enforce any particular project structure. The good thing about this is that it allows you to make up a structure to suit your needs. The bad thing is that it is not possible to provide you an ideal structure that would work for every project.
